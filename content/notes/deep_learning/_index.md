Lately it seems that everyone is interested in deep learning. 
There's a good reason why this is the case, this technology promises to solve a lot of problems -- from self-driving cars and diagnosing cancer to ... solving Atari games:

Just like everyone else, and probably you, I was sold on the idea that deep learning is useful (and interesting).
So to learn about ... deep learning, I decided to build my own toy neural network framework and document it here.
