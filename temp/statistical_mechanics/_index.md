> "Ludwig Boltzmann, who spent much of his life studying statistical mechanics, died in 1906 by his own hand. Paul Ehrenfest, carrying on the work, died similarly in 1933. Now it is our turn to study statistical mechanics. Perhaps it will be wise to approach the subject cautiously."[^1]

DISCLAIMER...\\
I am not an authority on statistical mechanics. 
In fact I've never formally been taught the subject, which is the main reason I started making these notes in the first place.
The reason I decided to put these notes online was to make myself accountable, the same way an exam would if I were taking this as a course at university.
